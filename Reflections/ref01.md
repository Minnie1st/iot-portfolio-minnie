# Reflection 1 in Module 1

## What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?Take-away can be small summary, but better outstanding points.
1. Today finally made IoT feel "real" to me. Before, it was all abstract concepts, but now I’ve actually used Node-RED to connect a sensor, send temperature data, and display it on a dashboard. It’s like magic—no writing hundreds of lines of code! Just dragging nodes and wiring logic.
2. My tiny confidence boost
  
## What was good?
The class felt like a playground—no pressure to cram theory for exams. The professor made everything lighthearted, almost like we were tinkering with IoT gadgets for fun. 

When I got stuck (which happened a lot!),the TA patiently walked me through issues without rushing and guided me step-by-step.

No pressure, Learning by doing > learning by memorizing. just curiosity-driven learning.
  
## What was difficult, where did you struggle?
Starting from zero with Node-RED was overwhelming.Every step felt like guesswork. we wasted time figuring out basic flows. I believe that once I get familiar with it and use it more, I'll pick it up quickly.

The sensor’s buttons were another mystery =.=

## Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration?Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors? 
Yes!！Refreshing Node-RED wiped our entire flow and loaded someone else’s flow instead. We asked the professor, but even he wasn’t sure why the port conflict happened. We lost our work. Next time, I’ll save a backup copy of my flow before experimenting. Lesson learned the hard way.

## How was your interaction with peers/instructors?
Encouraging, approachable, collaborative

## Help and extra work
  - Who helped you, gave feedback, was it valuable?

Juan helped me decode how nodes connect in Node-RED—like why the "sensor" talks to "debug." His tips turned my confusion into clarity. Super valuable!


  - Who did you help, gave feedback to?

For now no

  - Did you present, implement, made a PR, or fix something that was crucial for the class in itself?

For now no
