# Reflection 3 in Module 2

## What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?Take-away can be small summary, but better outstanding points.
1. Comparison and Application Scenarios of Buses
2. How to use PlatformIO

## Describe the session formats
1. I accidentally short-circuited my ESP8266. it was a “fantastic” learning experience for me! After some intense troubleshooting (and a moment of silence for the fallen microcontroller), I finally understood how breadboards actually work. Now, I double-check my wiring before powering up… most of the time.I’m lucky my laptop is still alive!！
2. I would say having more live demonstrations of the experiments, where the instructor shows how to perform each step, would help us understand the process better. Sometimes, seeing the process in action makes it easier to grasp the concepts and avoid mistakes.
  
## What was good?
Blink an LED Success
  
## What was difficult, where did you struggle?
Dependency on AI-generated Code. I dont like 

## Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration?Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors? 
Experimenting with Micro Servo Motors. this device can translate PWM signals into precise angular motion (e.g., simulating robotic joints). This revelation sparked ideas for automation scenarios, such as smart curtain control.

## How was your interaction with peers/instructors?
collaborative

## Help and extra work
  - Who helped you, gave feedback, was it valuable?

I want to give a huge thank you to Ulno and Renato for their incredible patience and support. They spent so much time after class helping me troubleshoot, explaining concepts, and making sure I didn’t turn more ESP8266s into tiny heaters. Their guidance not only helped me understand IoT hardware better but also made the learning process much more enjoyable. I truly appreciate their dedication and kindness!!!

  - Who did you help, gave feedback to?

My previous partner decided not to continue with the course, so I got a new one. After completing the experiment on my own, I took the time to teach my new partner how to carry out the tasks. I explained the steps and made sure he understood the concepts involved.

  - Did you present, implement, made a PR, or fix something that was crucial for the class in itself?

For now no
