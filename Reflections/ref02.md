# Reflection 2 in Module 2

## What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?Take-away can be small summary, but better outstanding points.
1. Thanks to Chinese rigorous 12-year basic education,My middle school physics knowledge save the day >.<
2. Breadboard ≠ Paper . Drawing schematics was easy, but translating them to the breadboard felt like solving a 3D puzzle.I finally understood why I was confused about it. The breadboard has its own conductive logic, where only the columns are connected, not the rows.
  
## What was good?
Hands-On Success
  
## What was difficult, where did you struggle?
Why can a relay control a large current with a small current? Why does a locker locked when the relay is powered on?  

I don’t just want a copied experiment procedure—I’ve been thinking about the principles. Maybe this is actually a physics question.

After class, I looked up some materials and found the answer. It turns out that the smart lock uses this principle.

## Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration?Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors? 
we experimented with different resistor values to see how they affected the LED brightness. It was fun to visually observe how current-limiting resistors work in practice.

## How was your interaction with peers/instructors?
collaborative

## Help and extra work
  - Who helped you, gave feedback, was it valuable?

For now no

  - Who did you help, gave feedback to?

For now no

  - Did you present, implement, made a PR, or fix something that was crucial for the class in itself?

For now no
