# Reflection 5 in Module 3

## What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?Take-away can be small summary, but better outstanding points.
1.Netbird showed me how devices can talk directly (like walkie-talkies!) without a central server. Decentralized networks = simpler IoT connections.

2.IoTempower works like digital LEGO: change WiFi names/passwords via a command-line menu, manage devices, and build a mini IoT system in minutes. Perfect for quick prototypes!

## What was good?
The instructor's live demos were super detailed. Even when I zoned out, I could catch up because every step was clearly displayed on the screen.

## What was difficult, where did you struggle?
setting up the system on old laptop, take toooooooooo much time

## Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration?Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors? 
nooooo, we don't have enought time to finish all the projects.

## How was your interaction with peers/instructors?
I would say not good. we wasted toooooo much time. we relied too heavily on TA for step-by-step solutions instead of troubleshooting independently. It wasn’t the most effective way to learn. After class, I will re-do everything.
