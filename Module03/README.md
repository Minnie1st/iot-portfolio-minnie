# Module 3

1.Adafruit video about transports 

Which protocols are covered

For each protocol, note down one advantage or outstanding feature and one disadvantage.

What else stood out?


| **Transport Technology**        | **Protocols**                   | **Advantage/Outstanding Feature**                          | **Disadvantage**                                   |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Ethernet**                     | Ethernet (IEEE 802.3)           | High reliability, low latency, ideal for data-intensive applications | Requires physical connection, limiting mobility  |
| **WiFi**                         | IEEE 802.11                     | High-speed data transfer, widely used, supports many devices | Limited range, signal interference from obstacles |
| **Bluetooth & BTLE**             | Bluetooth (Classic & BTLE)      | Low power consumption (BTLE), ideal for short-range device connections, Classic Bluetooth supports high data needs like audio | Short range, limited bandwidth, not ideal for large data transfers |
| **Cellular & Satellite**         | GSM, CDMA, LTE, Satellite       | Global coverage, suitable for remote areas and global communication | High cost, low data transfer speed, latency in satellite communication |
| **ZigBee & Z-Wave**              | IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee) & Proprietary Protocol (Z-Wave) | Low power, supports mesh networking for a large number of devices, great for smart homes | Low data transfer rate, limited range, suitable for low-bandwidth applications |
| **LoRa & SigFox**                | LoRa Protocol & SigFox Protocol | Long-range communication, low power, ideal for remote IoT sensor networks | Extremely low data transfer rate, not suitable for high-bandwidth applications |


Other Key Points That Stood Out:

Low Power Design: Many protocols like BTLE, ZigBee, and LoRa are designed for low power consumption, which is ideal for battery-powered IoT devices.
Global Coverage: Cellular and satellite technologies (such as LTE, Satellite) offer global coverage, making them useful for communication in remote or hard-to-reach areas.
Scalability and Network Management: Protocols like ZigBee and Z-Wave use mesh networking, allowing devices to communicate over a larger area by relaying messages between devices.

We are going to show here notes for Task N to prove


## Task 1

This task was executed by my partner and me.
Mini Project: IoTempower networking

## Task 2

This task was executed by myself.
Mini Project: MQTT listens everywhere

## Task 3

This task was executed by myself.
Mini Project: FirstAid station emergency button (very interesting)

## Task 4

This task didn't finish, I have tried many times. On Manjaro, when trying to install Netbird using yay netbird, I always get a "wrong password" error. My partner also doesn't know the password, which has prevented us from completing this project!ðŸ˜’
Mini Project: Remote access to the gateway
