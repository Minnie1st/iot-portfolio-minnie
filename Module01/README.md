# Module 1

## Task Inspirations

- Inspiration 1
Smart planter！may be I can automate feeding schedules and track my dog's health using sensors

- Inspiration 2
Smart Nursing Home! I've been wanting to optimize my smart home system for a long time—scene modes often fail to work properly.

## Task Personal Profile
Cross-disciplinary thinker.

I switched from computer science to psychology almost as soon as I started, when I realized analyzing why people behave fascinated me more than coding alone. 

Never dabbled in hardware.. True, but I’m decently hands-on—at least I can assemble Lego sets or IKEA furniture without leftover screws hhhh

Math and stats are my comfort zone.

I go all in on what excites me, but let’s just say… human curiosity has its limits for the rest=。=

Life’s journey is never a waste。。。unless it involves me soldering circuit boards=。=

## Task What is IoT
IoT refers to a network of interconnected physical devices (e.g., sensors, appliances, machines) that collect, share, and act on data via the internet. It combines embedded systems, cloud computing, and data analytics to enable automation, real-time decision-making, and enhanced efficiency across industries.

emmmmmm ..it is like giving "brains" to everyday objects. your fridge texts you when you’re out of milk, streetlights dim automatically when no one’s around, or a farm waters crops by itself when the soil gets dry. It’s stuff talking to stuff, making life smoother without you lifting a finger.

## Domains and included areas:

-Smart Home (automated appliances, energy management),

-Industrial IoT (IIoT) (predictive maintenance, supply chain optimization),

-Smart Cities (traffic control, waste management, public safety),

-Healthcare (remote patient monitoring, smart medical devices),

-Agriculture (soil/weather sensors, precision farming),

-Wearables (fitness trackers, health analytics).


## Commonly used (data) protocols:

-MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)

-AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol)

## Typical devices (appliance or micro controller):

-thermostats

-security cameras (or ring)

-Apple Watch

## Challenges:

-Data fusion

-Privacy & Security Risks

-Brand/protocol silos crippling interoperability
