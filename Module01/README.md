## Task Personal Profile

## Task What is IoT
IoT refers to a network of interconnected physical devices (e.g., sensors, appliances, machines) that collect, share, and act on data via the internet. It combines embedded systems, cloud computing, and data analytics to enable automation, real-time decision-making, and enhanced efficiency across industries.

emmmmmm ..it is like giving "brains" to everyday objects. your fridge texts you when you’re out of milk, streetlights dim automatically when no one’s around, or a farm waters crops by itself when the soil gets dry. It’s stuff talking to stuff, making life smoother without you lifting a finger.

## Domains and included areas:

-Smart Home (automated appliances, energy management),

-Industrial IoT (IIoT) (predictive maintenance, supply chain optimization),

-Smart Cities (traffic control, waste management, public safety),

-Healthcare (remote patient monitoring, smart medical devices),

-Agriculture (soil/weather sensors, precision farming),

-Wearables (fitness trackers, health analytics).


## Commonly used (data) protocols:

-MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)

-AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol)

## Typical devices (appliance or micro controller):

-thermostats

-security cameras (or ring)

-Apple Watch

## Challenges:

-Data fusion

-Privacy & Security Risks

-Brand/protocol silos crippling interoperability
