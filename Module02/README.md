This task was executed by my partner. The implementation was about ... 
It is [here](https://github.com/partner/iot-portfolio/Module02/Readme.md#task-2).

## Task 3

This task was executed by myself. and then I did it again with my partner. we tested water ，aluminum foil and orange.

## Task 5 Combination Challenge
I plan to use an M5StickC to control an LED connected to PIN 26, making it blink on and off every second with a resistor in the circuit. The M5StickC is powered via USB-C, and the setup includes a breadboard for connections. However, since the LED does not light up, the only reason is that the LED is likely broken.
